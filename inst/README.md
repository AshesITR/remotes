Download and install R packages stored in GitHub repositories.
This R package is a lightweight replacement of
`devtools::install_github()`.

## Installation

You can install `remotes` from GitHub. If you already have a previous
version of `remotes` installed, you can use that to install the new
versions:

```r
remotes::install_github("mangothecat/remotes")
```

Otherwise you can call the supplied `install-github.R`
file directly, from within R:

```r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MangoTheCat/remotes/master/install-github.R")$value("mangothecat/remotes")
```

## Usage

To install the latest version in the `master` branch from GitHub,
you can use the `user/repo` form. Note that `user` can also be
an organization:

```r
remotes::install_github("mangothecat/franc")
```

If the R package is inside a subdirectory of the root directory,
then give this subdirectory as well:

```r
remotes::install_github("dmlc/xgboost/R-package")
```

To install a certain branch or commit or tag, append it to the
repo name, after an `@`:

```r
remotes::install_github("gaborcsardi/pkgconfig@v2.0.0")
```

To install the latest release, append `@*release` to the repo
name:

```r
remotes::install_github("gaborcsardi/pkgconfig@*release")
```

To install a pull request, append `#` and the id (an integer number)
of the pull request to the repo name:

```r
remotes::install_github("mangothecat/pkgsnap#10")
```

### Dependencies

Dependencies are automatically installed from CRAN. By default,
outdated dependencies are automatically upgraded.

#### Dependencies on GitHub

It is also possible to install dependencies from GitHub. For this
you need to add a `Remotes` field to the `DESCRIPTION` file.
Its format is:
```
Remotes: [remote::]repo_spec, [remote::]repo_spec, ...
```
where `repo_spec` is any repository specification `install_github`
can handle. If `remote::` is missing, `github::` is assumed.
Note that currently only the `github::` and `git::` remote types are
supported by `remotes`. The [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools)
package supports more remote types.

#### BioConductor packages

BioConductor packages are automatically detected and their
dependencies are installed from BioConductor. Note that you
need to have the `BiocInstaller` package installed to
install BioConductor packages with `remotes`.

### Notes

If the package has git submodules, then the installation will likely
fail. Nevertheless, a warning is given in this case.
